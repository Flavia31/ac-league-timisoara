OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities Application Examples

# Disclosure
None of the solutions gathered here are production ready! 

One should treat them with care and not deploy to public web sites.

# Structure
One folder for each vulnerability. 

Each folder will contain a subfolder named "before" where the vulnerable solution is. 

Students will create a new folder named "after" by making a copy of the "before" folder where we will fix the vulnerabilities.
